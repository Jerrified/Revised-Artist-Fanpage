                                                <p>
                                                    Sometimes called the father of modern art, Spanish artist Francisco 
                                                    de Goya painted royal portraits as well as more subversive works in 
                                                    late 1700s and early 1800s.

                                                <p>
                                                    A famed painter in his own lifetime, Francisco de Goya began his art 
                                                    studies as a teenager and even spent time in Rome, Italy, to advance 
                                                    his skills. In the 1770s, Goya began to work for the Spanish royal 
                                                    court. In addition to his commissioned portraits of the nobility, he 
                                                    created works that criticized the social and political problems of his era.

                                                <p>
                                                    Goya also used his art to record moments of the country's history. In 1808, 
                                                    France, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, invaded Spain. Napoleon installed his 
                                                    brother Joseph as the country's new leader. While he remained a court painter 
                                                    under Napoleon, Goya created a series of etchings depicting the horrors of war. 
                                                    After Spanish royalty regained the throne in 1814, he then painted "The Third 
                                                    of May," which showed the true human costs of war. The work depicted the 
                                                    uprising in Madrid against French forces.
